## Features

- The website displays the prices of the top 100 cryptocurrencies in real-time.
- Users can search for and track the prices of their favorite cryptocurrencies.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional features to the website such as:

- The ability to view historical price data and create charts.
